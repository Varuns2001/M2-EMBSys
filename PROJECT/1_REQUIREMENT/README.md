 # CONTROLLING DC MOTOR USING ARDUINO AND IR REMOTE
# INTRODUCTION:
<br>
1)In this project we will learn how to decode IR remote signals with Arduino and to control DC motors depending on the button pressed.<br>For demonstrating the working we are using five buttons on the remote. When the next button on the remote is pressed, motors will rotate in clockwise direction.<br>
 2)And if the previous button is pressed motors will rotate in anticlockwise direction. We can also control these two motors individually using left, right arrow buttons and stop button can be used to stop the rotation.<br>
 3}We are using 1838 IR receiver (AX-1838HS, TL1838, TSOP1838)  for sensing IR signals transmitted from the remote. Arduino Uno is the brain of this project.<br>

 # COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
 <br>
1.Arduino Uno.<br>
2.IR Sensor 1838.<br>
3.IR Remote (TV remote or any other IR remote will work fine).<br>
4.L293D DC Motor Driver IC.<br>
5.2x DC Motors.<br>
6.9V Battery.<br>
7.Breadboard.<br>
8.Connecting Wires.<br>

# REQUIREMENT:<br>
HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT:<br>
1.Arduino should get the corresponding sinal from the IR sensor.<br>
2.IR remote should control the motor properly.<br>

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT:<br>
1.The components should be in proper working condition.<br>
2.The inputs/outputs should get correctly.<br>

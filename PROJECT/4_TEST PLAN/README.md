Firstly we can connect IR sensor to Arduino Uno.<br>

Connect the left pin of IR sensor which is ground to the ground of the Arduino<br>
Connect the middle pin which is 5V input to the 5V output pin of the Arduino.<br>
Connect the right pin which is signal output pin to the digital pin 2 of the Arduino.<br>
We are using a 9V battery to power 2 DC motors.<br>
Now we can connect L293D IC to Arduino Uno. The pin out of the IC is shown below.<br>
